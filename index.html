  <p>
    In 2025, more Americans than ever are qualifying for free government devices through federal assistance programs like Lifeline and the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). These programs provide eligible low-income households with free or heavily discounted smartphones, tablets, and even iPhones. Devices come pre-loaded with features to help users stay connected for school, work, telehealth, and more. With the rapid expansion of digital equity initiatives, access to technology is no longer a luxury but a right.
